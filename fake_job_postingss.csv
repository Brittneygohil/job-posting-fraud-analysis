Attention to detail and a curiosity to jump into our development process is a must.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONWhat will you work on? Rippleshot uses Machine Learning and Big Data to analyze credit card transactions in ways that haven't been possible before. Millions of records are processed per day and loaded into a hadoop cluster. From there, the machine learning algorithm will compare that data with verified fraud to identify merchants that may have suffered a data breach earlier than current manual methods. This data is loaded into a Ruby on Rails platform which acts as an AJAX back-end for the Javascript data visualization front end. This JS front-end uses AngularJS and D3 to make it even easier for users to see data breaches as quickly as they are detected.ABOUT USIn our 15 years of experience identifying and mitigating card fraud, we’ve seen the problem grow from a transaction-level headache to a commerce-threatening phenomenon. In 2012 the founders came together to change the fight against fraud by creating Rippleshot.We take a big data machine learning approach that is familiar to search, genetics and advertising and apply it in a novel way for the payment processing industry. We focus on merchant instead of consumer behavior. We monitor millions of merchants and their transactions, searching through the data for subtle behavioral patterns that indicate the early stages of a breach. We use sophisticated statistics and modeling to distinguish between real breaches and nearby stores that share many of the same patrons, resulting in very accurate assessments.",Full-time,Mid-Senior level,Bachelor's Degree,Information Technology and Services,Information Technology,0

Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.It just works.Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.Open standards, open minds.We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.Strong partnerships.Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.What we do:High availability and high performance website architecture &amp; developmentWeb content management solutionsCreative technology ideationContent optimisation, search and analyticsHigh volume, multi-locale email campaignsMobile optimisationLocalisation","The increasingly complex web applications, mobile sites and applications, and digital experiences we build require novel user interfaces that work more like applications than websites, and are built upon the market leading Adobe Experience Manager platform (formerly known as CQ5). The Technical Architect for AEM CMS leads members of the VML Technical team in the creation, specification, costing, production and post-production of CMS driven web development projects. The Technical Architect in particular bridges both the client side and server side of our applications, helping to make a reality VML’s goal to apply the same quality processes used to build enterprise server applications to build enterprise JavaScript applications on the client side. The complexity of VML’s AEM site builds varies from simple editorially driven websites using out of the box AEM features, to transactional websites integrated with backend services using client side or edge side page assembly, to data driven websites integrating with data services using OSGi bundles. Some VML AEM sites use extensions for mobile device support or social communities, and increasingly VML is required to integrate AEM sites with wider features of the Adobe Marketing Cloud product suite. The software we build runs business critical systems with high performance, high availability requirements for some of the UK’s leading brands, taking millions of pounds per day in sales and being design to cope with tens of thousands of page impressions per second. As such, VML is looking for an engineer and architect who favours disciplined development and testing practices to the more trial and error approach that is often applied to campaign related digital marketing work, and applies techniques such as continuous integration, continuous testing and static code analysis to maintain quality. The successful applicant will have a minimum of 7 years of experience with a range of enterprise Java technologies and content management systems, with at least two years experience with AEM/CQ5 and ideally familiarity with client side technologies as well, especially MVC pattern JavaScript applications.

Sometimes we sleep in the office. Sometimes we chat with clients at 3am. Sometimes we don't sleep at all. We work on weekends. We're hustlers and thrive on the craziness. But, we all have balanced lives outside of work and prioritize those things that are important to us. Family, friends, nights out, music, and the abundant nature that exists outside of our beautiful city - we play just as hard as we work.Defend or DieAt GoRefi, we're insanely passionate about fixing our broken industry. Transparency with our clients is paramount so it's only natural that our work environment embody the same openness. With so many ideas and only so much bandwidth to execute, open communication is key. We're small, lean, and nimble so your opinion is expected and respected. But, when you present an idea, be ready to defend it - because we question everything. It's this type of collaboration that helps us decide what to focus our energies on next.Strive for PerfectionWe fail every day, and it's awesome, because it means we're getting closer. There's a push to get our features out there and it's often a sacrifice to hit those deadlines, but given the sensitive nature of what GoRefi does, putting features out just for the sake of putting features out doesn't fly. We prefer to take a bit of extra time to do it right, even though we're moving at light speed compared to our competitors.Don't be a ""Larry""No offense if your name is Larry, of course. In this example, Larry's the typical used-car salesman selling you rust protection when you live in California or the fly-by-night mortgage broker charging you exorbitant fees and putting you in the wrong loan. This lie-cheat-steal crap is all over the web and in case you couldn't tell already - we're sick of it. A Larry is enticed by quotas - not service - and is compensated without justification of hours worked or exceptional performance. They sell for themselves and for their wallet, with a short-term vision that hurts everyone in their lives, especially their customers. At GoRefi, we don't have a Sales Department - we only have Support. Our clients get what's best for them and only them. Our motive is and always will be to ensure that our clients are happy with their experience.","Full-Stack Software Engineer - San Francisco/Fairfax, CA#URL_4b8a8c7911c73321dea3236076d03c7a75f783e4b6fd81447c55fc17976370d8#GoRefi is building a platform for automating the front-end mortgage origination process, an annual $1.8T vertical that ultimately touches the lives of over 70 million Americans.

More specifically, their job is to apply their knowledge of oil and gas, and how these hydrocarbons behave at a high pressure, in order to estimate the recoverable volume of the hydrocarbons, and maximize the recovery of the resources from subsurface reservoirs.There are several types of petroleum engineering jobs: reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, and production engineering jobs.Reservoir engineers are in charge of tasks related to well placement, oil recovery, and production rates, and they work to improve the production of oil and gas. Their job is to apply their knowledge of how oil and gas flow through rocks and what forces are involved in order to forecast the performance of reservoirs, set up well-drainage patterns, and improve the overall production efficiency.Drilling engineers deal with the technical tasks of drilling production and injection wells. They design drilling techniques, choose safety and casing equipment and decide on the direction of the operations.Production engineers evaluate lift methods, choose the equipment used to separate oil, water and natural gas, and are in charge of managing the interface between the reservoir and the well. Their job typically begins after the well has been completed. They manage and measure the fluids, design storage systems, and supply pipeline companies with oil and gas.Petroleum geology is another subdiscipline in the field of petroleum engineering, one that deals with analysis of subsurface structures for the purpose of finding hydrocarbons.",Full-time,Executive,Bachelor's Degree,Oil & Energy,Engineering,0

Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.It just works.Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands.

Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it.

Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.Strong partnerships.Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.What we do:High availability and high performance website architecture &amp; developmentWeb content management solutionsCreative technology ideationContent optimisation, search and analyticsHigh volume, multi-locale email campaignsMobile optimisationLocalisation","As Senior Java Enterprise Developer you will have an excellent understanding of how to build modern web applications including high availability CMS driven sites with thousands of pages, campaign specific microsites including Facebook apps, RESTful or SOAP web services.

Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.It just works.Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.Open standards, open minds.We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.Strong partnerships.Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.What we do:High availability and high performance website architecture &amp; developmentWeb content management solutionsCreative technology ideationContent optimisation, search and analyticsHigh volume, multi-locale email campaignsMobile optimisationLocalisation","The increasingly complex web applications, mobile sites and applications, and digital experiences we build require novel user interfaces that work more like applications than websites. The Technical Architect for web technologies leads members of the VML Technical team in the creation, specification, costing, production and post-production of CMS driven web development projects. In particular, VML considers that the same quality processes used to build enterprise server applications can be applied to build enterprise JavaScript applications on the client side. Using technologies such as the AngularJS framework to build advanced transactional web applications following the MVVM pattern, VML applies the same rigorous quality software engineering and architectural approach to client side code as we do to our enterprise server applications. As such VML is looking for an engineer and architect who favours disciplined development and testing practices to the more trial and error approach that is often applied to campaign related digital marketing work. The software we build runs business critical systems with high performance, high availability requirements for some of the UK’s leading brands, taking millions of pounds per day in sales and being design to cope with tens of thousands of page impressions per second. The successful applicant will have a minimum of 7 years of experience with a range of HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies and ideally server side technologies as well.
